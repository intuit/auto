This is an awesome way to accomplish automated releases, but it is very strict and can create more work when accepting outside contribution. PR labels solve this problem beautifully, but...\n\nThat's exactly why we made the conventional-commits plugin. It allows you to keep your conventional commit work flow but still get the benefits of PR labels based automation.\nTo start using conventional commit style commit messages simply add the following to your auto config.\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"conventional-commits\"]\n}\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"conventional-commits\"]\n}\n\nNow you can enjoy the best of both worlds! 🎉"

Taking in all the changes at once can be overwhelming. It makes it easy to miss smaller mistakes and can make it hard to guess the intent of the changes. Multiple features, bug fixes, or even breaking changes may make up this large PR.\nOne way to manage this problem is by making a PR to the large PR. Other contributors can review a smaller subset of changes and also follow along with development. In previous versions of auto, large PRs would not be represented well in the changelog and release notes. It would only include the main PR that got merged into baseBranch as the only changelog note.\nBut thanks to this PR that isn't true anymore! Now when you merge one PR to another both changes will be represented in the changelog.\n\nScore!\n\nFor example in PR #351 we changed what happens when you call shipit from a PR. Previously if you called shipit it would create a new release and publish it to the latest tag. The PR made it so shipit would create a canary release when run in a PR and only publish to latest from the master branch.\nAnother contributor to the project pointed out that some users might not be using master as their base branch, so the baseBranch should be configurable.\nInstead of waiting for #351 to get merged to write the baseBranch functionality, I could make a PR to #351 and both PRs would be represented in the changelog!\n\n\n\n\nNow you can be a little more creative with how you manage large PR and have even more detailed changelogs."
