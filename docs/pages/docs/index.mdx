> Automated releases powered by pull request labels

Streamline your release workflow and publish constantly!
`auto` is meant to be run in a continuous integration (CI) environment, but all the commands work locally as well.

The two main problems auto is trying to solve are: release automation and pull request interaction.
With the set of tools we provide you can automate every part of contribution!

<br />

**Release Features:**

- Calculate semantic version bumps from PRs
- Publish [canaries](./docs/generated/canary) (test versions) directly from PRs or locally
- Generate changelogs with fancy headers, authors, and [detailed release notes](./docs/generated/changelog#additional-release-notes)
- Make GitHub releases

**Pull Request Interaction Features:**

- Get the labels for a PR
- Set the status of a PR
- Comment on a PR with markdown
- Update the PR body with contextual build metadata

## Workflow

`auto`'s main use it to automate the release process for your project.
This can be broken down into three core steps:

```text
pre: (optional) Check if new version

1. Generate CHANGELOG.md
2. Publish code
3. Generate github release notes
```

`auto` makes no assumptions about your publishing process.
Each tool is a function that can be run in isolation and only does one thing really well.
For instance, you could just use `auto changelog` to generate the changelog and nothing else or use `auto version` to calculate just the `semver` bump.
