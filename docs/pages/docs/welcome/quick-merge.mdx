title: Merging Quickly
---

One caveat of `auto` is that you need to be mindful of merging multiple PRs at once.
You **must not** merge a PR while another is publishing (ex: during `lerna publish`).
While this window is small, it exists and you should know about it.

`auto` works by looking at the `git` tree to calculate the version bump then makes commits for the `CHANGELOG.md` and the new version.
If you merge a PR while another is publishing:

- they might try to publish the same version number
- one will try to push over the other's changes and fail

> If you ensure that the last build on `baseBrach` has finished you shouldn't run into any problems!

### Beware Long Publishes

`auto` will do the following before trying to `publish` and push its commits:

- Check for commits on the remote
- Run the platform specific `publish` step

If your `publish` step runs a lengthy build, then the window for conflicts is extended.
The recommended approach is to build your code before running `auto` so the window for errors stays small.
This may make sense on some platforms and not others.

> Example: When using the `npm` plugin don't use the script `prepublishOnly` to build your code

## With `skip-release`

The one exception to this rule with when merging a bunch of PRs with `skip-release` labels.

You still can't merge a PR that triggers a release and then merge a PR with `skip-release`.
This will result in problem 3 from above.

```txt
1. Merge PR #4 "patch"
2. Merge PR #5 "skip-release"

Result: #4 tries to push commits over #5 and fails
```

But you can merge a bunch of PRs with `skip-release` then merge a PR that triggers a release.

```txt
1. Merge PR #4 "skip-release"
2. Merge PR #5 "skip-release"
3. Merge PR #7 "patch"

Result: 1 "patch" released w/all PRs
```

Because `skip-release` is present no commits are made and the release is fine!
