Plugins work by "hooking" into various parts of `auto` to control or add to its behavior.

The categories of hooks available to plugins are:

- [Init](./init-hooks) - Add functionality to `auto init`
- [Configuration](./configuration-hooks) - Detect, modify and validate `auto`'s configuration
- [Log Parser](./log-parse-hooks) - Extend how `auto` analyzes commits
- [Changelog](./changelog-hooks) - Change how `auto` renders changelogs
- [Release Lifecycle](./release-lifecycle-hooks) - Called during various release commands, these facilitate publishing the package

The hooks that are called depends on the command is run.
Some hooks are specific to a single command, such as the "Init" hooks, and others are called for every command.

Here is a map of all the hooks and when they are called (open in new tab for more detail):

## Plugin Ideas

Having a plug-able release process means you can automate so many things.
Here are a few ideas of what you could do.

- `size-changelog`: Every time a `latest` release is made update a `size-changelog.md` with the bundle size
- Use the `afterRelease` hook to communicate changes to consumers (ex: twitter or slack)

The documentation for each hook also lists examples of how the hook is used in various parts of `auto` and its plugins.
