title: Release Lifecycle Hooks
---

The following hooks are all called during various release commands (ex: `latest`, `next`, `canary`, `shipit`).
These hooks is where the publishing of your package actually happens.

- [prCheck](#prCheck)
- [beforeShipIt](#beforeshipit)
- [beforeCommitChangelog](#beforecommitchangelog)
- [afterAddToChangelog](#afteraddtochangelog)
- [version](#version)
- [afterVersion](#afterversion)
- [publish](#publish)
- [afterPublish](#afterpublish)
- [canary](#canary)
- [next](#next)
- [makeRelease](#makerelease)
- [afterRelease](#afterrelease)
- [afterShipIt](#aftershipit)

## prCheck

Called before `auto pr-check` is ran/

Context Object:

- `pr` - All github information related to the PR

```ts
auto.hooks.prCheck.tapPromise("NPM", async ({ pr }) => {
  // Do stuff
});
```

## beforeShipIt

Happens before `shipit` is run.
This is a great way to throw an error if a token or key is not present.

Context Object:

- `releaseType` (`latest` | `old` | `next` | `canary`) - The type of release `shipit` will attempt to make.
- `dryRun` - Whether the run is a dry run

```ts
auto.hooks.beforeShipIt.tapPromise("NPM", async (context) => {
  if (!process.env.NPM_TOKEN) {
    throw new Error("NPM Token is needed for the NPM plugin!");
  }
});
```

_Other examples:_

- [all-contributors](../generated/all-contributors) - Manage manual contribution additions in PRs
- [gh-pages](../generated/gh-pages) - Publishes your docs to GitHub pages on a `latest` release
- [npm](../generated/npm) - Exits early when lerna won't need to make a release

## beforeCommitChangelog

Ran before the `changelog` command commits the new release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
Useful for modifying the changelog as a whole or creating extra `changelog` files.
These files can be apart of the commit that updates the changelog.

- `bump` - the semver bump
- `commits` - the commits in the changelog
- `currentVersion` - version that was just released
- `lastRelease` - the version before the current version
- `releaseNotes` - generated release notes for the release

```ts
auto.hooks.beforeCommitChangelog.tap(
  "MyPlugin",
  async ({ currentVersion, commits, releaseNotes, lastRelease }) => {
    // do something
  }
);
```

_Other examples:_

- In Core: Create major version branches when `major` happens
- [npm](../generated/npm) - Create sub-package changelogs

## afterAddToChangelog

Ran after the `changelog` command adds the new release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`.
Useful for getting extra commits into a release before publishing.

- `bump` - the semver bump
- `commits` - the commits in the changelog
- `currentVersion` - version that was just released
- `lastRelease` - the version before the current version
- `releaseNotes` - generated release notes for the release

```ts
auto.hooks.afterAddToChangelog.tap(
  "MyPlugin",
  async ({ currentVersion, commits, releaseNotes, lastRelease }) => {
    // do something
  }
);
```

_Other examples:_

- [all-contributors](../generated/all-contributors) - Make a commit for new contributions

## version

Increment the version the package.
This is a good opportunity to `git tag` the release also.
This hooks is required for plugin that facilitate publishing.

Here `npm` does it for us.

```ts
auto.hooks.version.tapPromise("NPM", async ({ bump, dryRun }) => {
  if (dryRun) {
    const { version } = await loadPackageJson();
    console.log(inc(version, bump));
    return;
  }

  await execPromise("npm", [
    "version",
    bump,
    "-m",
    "Bump version to: %s [skip ci]",
  ]);
});
```

> If you're implementing this hook for a publishing plugin you **must** commit (with `[skip ci]` in the message) and tag the version.

## afterVersion

Ran after the package has been versioned.

_Examples:_

- In Core: Used to exit early is new commits are detected on the remote
- [brew](../generated/brew) - Create a new brew formula once the package a=has been versioned

```ts
auto.hooks.version.tapPromise("NPM", async ({ dryRun }) => {

});
```

## publish

Publish the package to some package distributor.
You must push the tags to github!
This hooks is required for plugin that facilitate publishing.

```ts
auto.hooks.publish.tapPromise("NPM", async (version: SEMVER) => {
  await execPromise("npm", [
    "version",
    version,
    "-m",
    "Bump version to: %s [skip ci]",
  ]);
  await execPromise("npm", ["publish"]);
  await execPromise("git", [
    "push",
    "--follow-tags",
    "--set-upstream",
    auto.remote,
    "$branch",
  ]);
});
```

## afterPublish

Ran after the package has been published.

## canary

Used to publish a `canary` release.
In this hook you get the semver bump and the unique `canary` postfix ID.

You can either return a string value of just the version or an object containing the following which will be rendered within and HTML details element.

- `newVersion` - The version published in the `canary` release or a header for the details element.
- `details` - The body of the details element

```ts
auto.hooks.canary.tapPromise(this.name, async ({ bump, canaryIdentifier }) => {
  const lastRelease = await auto.git!.getLatestRelease();
  const current = await auto.getCurrentVersion(lastRelease);
  const nextVersion = inc(current, bump as ReleaseType);
  const isScopedPackage = name.match(/@\S+\/\S+/);
  const canaryVersion = `${nextVersion}-canary${canaryIdentifier}`;

  await execPromise("npm", ["version", canaryVersion, "--no-git-tag-version"]);
  await execPromise("npm", ["publish", "--tag", "canary"]);

  auto.logger.verbose.info("Successfully published canary version");
  return canaryVersion;
});
```

`canary` version should not produce any of the following:

- a new tag
- any commits
- a new release
- any changes to changelogs

It is "test" release and has no impact on any of your real releases.

## next

Used to publish a `next` release.
In this hook you get the semver bump and a list of all pre-releases made.

This hook **must** add the version it published to `preReleaseVersions` and return it.

- `preReleaseVersions` - A list of prerelease version publish during the current run
- `bump` - The version bump to apply

```ts
import {
  determineNextVersion,
  execPromise,
  getCurrentBranch,
} from "@auto-it/core";

auto.hooks.next.tapPromise(this.name, async (preReleaseVersions, bump, { dryRun }) => {
  const branch = getCurrentBranch() || "";
  const lastRelease = await auto.git.getLatestRelease();
  const current =
    (await auto.git.getLastTagNotInBaseBranch(branch)) ||
    (await auto.getCurrentVersion(lastRelease));
  // Use this helper function to determine the next prerelease version
  const prerelease = determineNextVersion(lastRelease, current, bump, "next");

  // Make sure to add the version to the list
  preReleaseVersions.push(prerelease);

  if (dryRun) {
    return preReleaseVersions;
  }

  // Create a new tag for it
  await execPromise("git", [
    "tag",
    prerelease,
    "-m",
    `"Tag pre-release: ${prerelease}"`,
  ]);
  // Push the tag
  await execPromise("git", ["push", auto.remote, "--tags"]);

  return preReleaseVersions;
});
```

`next` version should not produce any of the following:

- any commits
- any changes to changelogs

## makeRelease

Ran when trying to make a release during the `release` command has run.
This async hook gets the following arguments:

- `dryRun` - Whether this is a dry run
- `from` - Commit to start calculating the version from
- `newVersion` - The version being released
- `isPrerelease` - Whether the release being made is a prerelease
- `fullReleaseNotes` - The generated release notes for all of the commits
- `commits` - The commits included in the release

```ts
auto.hooks.makeRelease.tapPromise("MyPlugin", async (options) => {
  if (!options.dryRun) {
    this.logger.log.info(`Releasing ${options.newVersion} to GitHub.`);

    return this.git!.publish(
      options.fullReleaseNotes,
      options.newVersion,
      options.isPrerelease
    );
  }
});
```

_Other examples:_

- [npm](../generated/npm) - Create GitHub releases for sub-packages

## afterRelease

Ran after the `release` command has run, creating a new release on GitHub.
This async hook gets the following arguments:

- `lastRelease` - the version that existed prior to the current release
- `newVersion` - version that was just released
- `commits` - the commits in the release
- `releaseNotes` - generated release notes for the release
- `response` - the response returned from making the release

```ts
auto.hooks.afterRelease.tapPromise(
  "MyPlugin",
  async ({ lastRelease, newVersion, commits, releaseNotes, response }) => {
    // do something
  }
);
```

_Other examples:_

- [release](../generated/release) - Post comment on issues and PRs about release version
- [s3](../generated/s3) - Upload release assets to s3
- [slack](../generated/slack) - Post the release notes to slack
- [twitter](../generated/twitter) - Create a tweet about the new release
- [upload-assets](../generated/upload-assets) - Uses hook to upload files to newly created release

## afterShipIt

Ran after the `shipit` command has run.

- `newVersion` - The new version that was release
- `commits` - the commits in the release
- `data`
  - `context` - The type of release that was created (`latest`, `next`, `canary`, or `old`)

```ts
auto.hooks.afterShipIt.tap(
  "MyPlugin",
  async (newVersion, commits, { context }) => {
    // do something
  }
);
```

_Other examples:_

- [gradle](../generated/gradle) - Uses hook to setup next snapshot version
