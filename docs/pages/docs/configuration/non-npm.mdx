title: Non-npm Usage
---

If you're on some platform other than [npm](https://npmjs.com) it doesn't make sense to download `auto` through [npm](https://npmjs.com). For these situations we package `auto` for all major operating systems (`linux`, `osx`, `windows`).

## Installation

Simply download the appropriate version for your operating system and make it executable.

```bash
# Download a platform specific version of auto
curl -vkL -o - https://github.com/intuit/auto/releases/download/v11.1.6/auto-linux-x64.gz | gunzip > ~/auto
# Make auto executable
chmod a+x ~/auto
```

This executable contains all of the official `auto` plugins so you do not have to download anything extra. This version of `auto` uses the [git-tag](../generated/git-tag) plugins as the default instead of [npm](../generated/npm). If you specify any plugins this will be overridden.

### Installation via brew (OSX)

If you are on OSX you can install `auto` with brew.

```bash
brew tap intuit/auto https://github.com/intuit/auto
brew install auto
```

## Configuration

To configure `auto` to work with your project you will need to do two things

1. Create and configure a [`GH_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) environment variable
2. Create an `.autorc` for your project

### Making an `.autorc`

Using `auto` with any other package manager than [npm](https://npmjs.com) requires that you create an [`.autorc`](./autorc) at the root of your project.

1. `.autorc` - No plugins, `shipit` doesn't work. Enables [advanced setup](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs/welcome/getting-started#detailed-setup)

   ```json
   {
     "author": "Andrew Lisowski <lisowski54@gmail.com>",
     "plugins": []
   }
   ```

2. `.autorc` - `git-tag` plugin compatible with any platform. Enables [`shipit` usage](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs/generated/shipit)

   ```json
   {
     "author": "Andrew Lisowski <lisowski54@gmail.com>",
     "plugins": ["git-tag"]
   }
   ```

3. `.autorc` - With package manager plugin. [`shipit`](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs/generated/shipit) works, some configuration picked up from package manager package definition files. In the following `repo`, `owner`, and `author` are picked up from the `pom.xml`

   ```json
   {
     "plugins": ["maven"]
   }
   ```

## Usage

Now that you have `auto` all set up you can use all of it's commands!

```bash
~/auto shipit
```

> ℹ️ Tip: Using `auto` locally with an `.env` file is a great experience. See how [here](../welcome/getting-started#local-env).

## Plugins

As stated above, all of the official plugins (the ones included in this repo/docs) are included in the binary version of `auto`. However you might want to use an unofficial plugin or even write your own.

#### Local Plugins

One way to use unofficial plugins in a non-javascript project is to have a directory committed to your project where you store them.

You could:

- Write your own custom plugins and store them in here
- Copy a plugin from the internet

**`.autorc`:**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["./plugins/custom-plugin.js"]
}
```

#### Hosted Plugins

If you want to share your custom plugins between projects then you can host them on some SCM (ex: GitHub). A plugin just needs to consist of an `index.js` that implements your plugin. (or it could be as complex as any NPM package)

Edit your CI build to download these plugins when building.

```bash
mkdir plugins
git clone https://github.com/me/custom-plugin plugins/custom-plugin
```

**`.autorc`:**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["./plugins/custom-plugin"]
}
```

#### NPM Plugins

If distributed via NPM you could install those plugins globally through `npm`:

```bash
npm i -g auto-plugin-my-custom-plugin
```

**`.autorc`:**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["my-custom-plugin"]
}
```
