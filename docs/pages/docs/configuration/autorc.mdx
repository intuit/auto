title: \`auto\` Configuration File
---

import { DefaultLabelRenderer } from "../../../components/defaultLabelsRenderer";

`auto` uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) to find your config.
This means you can define this file a variety of ways.
`cosmiconfig` will start at the root of your project and start to search up the directory tree for the following:

- an `auto` package.json property
- a JSON or YAML, extension-less rc file ".autorc"
- an "rc file" with the extensions `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.ts` or `.js`
- a `auto.config.js` or `auto.config.js` CommonJS module
- a `auto.config.ts` TypeScript module

## Initialization

To interactively create an `.autorc` use the `init` command. You can configure most flags and all labels/changelogTitles.

```bash
auto init
```

## TypeScript Configuration

You can write your `auto` configuration in a TypeScript file for easier validation

**auto.config.ts:**

```ts
import { AutoRc } from "auto";

import { INpmConfig } from "@auto-it/core";
import { IAllContributorsPluginOptions } from "@auto-it/all-contributors";

/** Auto configuration */
export default function rc(): AutoRc {
  return {
    plugins: [
      "released",
      [
        "npm",
        {
          exact: true,
          canaryScope: "@auto-canary",
        } as INpmConfig,
      ],
      [
        "all-contributors",
        {
          types: {
            plugin: "**/plugin/**/*",
            code: ["**/src/**/*", "**/package.json", "**/tsconfig.json"],
          },
        } as IAllContributorsPluginOptions,
      ],
    ],
    labels: [
      {
        name: "blog-post",
        changelogTitle: "📚 Blog Post",
        releaseType: "none",
      },
    ],
  };
}
```

## Options

The following are all of the top level configuration options for `auto`.
While some of the following options also exist as flags to certain comments,
it is recommended to set them in an `.autorc` so your commands are terser and experience consistent.

### Only Publish With Release Label

Configure the default release behavior.

```json
{
  "onlyPublishWithReleaseLabel": true
}
```

### Base Branch

Configure what your repo considers the base branch.
Defaults to either `main` or `master`.

```json
{
  "baseBranch": "trunk"
}
```

### Plugins

It is useful to specify your plugins in the rc file rather than in all the commands.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["npm", "../path/to/plugin.js", "NPM_PACKAGE_NAME"]
}
```

### githubApi

If you are using enterprise github, `auto` lets you configure the github API URL that it uses.

```json
{
  "githubApi": "https://github.mine.com/api/v3"
}
```

### githubGraphqlApi

This is used for doing some searches in `auto`.

The default behavior will construct the root API url for GitHub Enterprise.
If you are using enterprise github and your company hosts the graphql at some other URL than the `githubApi`, you can use `githubGraphqlApi` to set the base path for `auto`.

```json
{
  "githubGraphqlApi": "https://github.mine.com/other/api/"
}
```

### author

The name and email to use with git.

```json
{
  "author": "Joe Schmo <joe@schmo.com>"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "author": {
    "name": "Joe Schmo",
    "email": "joe@schmo.com"
  }
}
```

### name

Name to use with git.

> NOTE: Will be deprecated in v10

```json
{
  "name": "Joe Schmo"
}
```

### email

Email to use with git.

> NOTE: Will be deprecated in v10

```json
{
  "email": "joe@schmo.com"
}
```

### noVersionPrefix

Do not make tags or releases with a `v` prefix.

```json
{
  "noVersionPrefix": true
}
```

### Command Defaults

For some commands you can supply defaults for some options.

**Example:** Adding the following to you `.autorc` will make `auto` only release pre-releases to GitHub.

```json
{
  "release": {
    "prerelease": true
  }
}
```

Please refer to each command's documentation to see which options are configurable.

---

### Exclusive Options

The following options can be set exclusively in the `.autorc` and do not exist as CLI flags.

### versionBranches

Create and manage old major releases.

```json
{
  "versionBranches": true,
  // or customize the branch prefix
  "versionBranches": "major-"
}
```

### Prerelease Branches

You can configure what branches `auto` treats as prerelease branches.
By default only `next` is treated as a prerelease branch.
If you configure `prereleaseBranches` it will override the default.

```json
{
  "prereleaseBranches": ["next", "beta"]
}
```

### Labels

To customize your project's labels use the `labels` section in your `.autorc`.

```json
{
  "labels": [
    { "releaseType": "major", "name": "Version: Major" },
    { "releaseType": "minor", "name": "Version: Minor" },
    { "releaseType": "patch", "name": "Version: Patch" },
    { "releaseType": "skip", "name": "NO!" },
    { "releaseType": "release", "name": "Autobots, rollout!" }
  ]
}
```

<DefaultLabelRenderer />

#### Label Customization

You can customize everything about a label

- `name` - The label text used for the label. If omitted defaults to the `key` value
- `releaseType` - The type of release to trigger (major, minor, patch, skip, release, or none)
- `overwrite` - Overwrite the default label(s) associated with the `releaseType`. (default: `false`)
- `changelogTitle` - The title to use in the changelog
- `description` - The description to use when creating the label
- `default` - Marks this label as the default label for unlabelled PRs (`patch` is the default "default label")
- `color` - The color of the label. Can be specified as a string in any of [these](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor#accepted-string-input) ways. If not specified the color is random

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "Version: Major",
      "changelogTitle": "The API has changed:",
      "description": "Add this label to a PR to create a major release",
      "color": "blue",
      "releaseType": "major"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Release Type: `none`

A label with the `none` release type will not create a release when merged.
If paired with a SEMVER label, the release is not skipped.

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "documentation",
      "releaseType": "none"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Changelog Titles

Each PR included in the release will be assigned to a label section based upon the matching label with the highest `releaseType` that has a `changelogTitle`.

- Priority order of `releaseType` from highest to lowest is: major, minor, patch, and then all others
- If a PR has multiple labels of the same `releaseType`, then the PR is assigned based upon the label that is assigned first in the config

By default auto will create sections in the changelog for the following labels:

- `major`
- `minor`
- `patch`
- `internal`
- `documentation`

For example:

- Using the default config, if a given PR has the labels `minor` and `internal`, then it will be included in the `minor` label section
- Using the default config, if a given PR has the labels `documentation` and `internal`, then it will be included in the `internal` label section

##### Updating Default Label Changelog Titles

To customize the title for the section in the changelog you can

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "documentation",
      "changelogTitle": "Docz"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Adding Additional Changelog Title Sections

If you want more sections in your changelog to further detail the change-set you can
use the `labels` section to add more. Any label in the label section with a changelogTitle
will become a special section in your changelog.

The following adds a `typescript` label to the project that we can use to denote changes
related to a TypeScript re-write.

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "typescript",
      "changelogTitle": "TypeScript Rewrite"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Removing Default Label Changelog Title Sections

You can remove the existing default label sections by adding a custom overwrite label with the same `releaseType`.

The following removes the default internal and documentation label sections:

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "Custom Doc Label",
      "changelogTitle": "Docz",
      "releaseType": "none",
      "overwrite": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extending

If you want to share your auto configuration between projects you can use the `extends` property.
This property will load from a module's `package.json` or from a custom path.
It's expected that the extended configuration be under the `auto` key in the `package.json` file.

Auto can load `extends` configs in the following ways:

- from a path `./path/to/config` (this file must be in JSON format)
- from a scoped package `@YOUR_SCOPE/auto-config` (under the `auto` key in the package.json)
- from a package `auto-config-YOUR_NAME`
- from a url `https://yourdomain.com/auto-config.json` (must return the content type `application/json`)

### Formats

```json
{
  "extends": "@YOUR_SCOPE"
}
```

Will use the package `@YOUR_SCOPE/auto-config`

```json
{
  "extends": "joe"
}
```

Will use the package `auto-config-joe`

> :warning: If extending from a config package make sure it's a dependency of your project

If you're extending from a local file it can be any file in JSON format or a `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "extends": "./path/to/config.json"
}
```

```json
{
  "extends": "./path/to/other/package.json"
}
```

### Custom Plugins

An `extends` configuration can include custom plugins in the NPM package.
This is useful if you have a shared plugin that doesn't necessarily need to be published as it's own package.

> NOTE: This does not work for `auto` configs stored in a url.

To include custom plugins just use a relative path in the extended configuration/

**`package.json`:**

```json
{
  "auto": {
    "plugins": ["./plugins/some-plugin.js"]
  }
}
```
