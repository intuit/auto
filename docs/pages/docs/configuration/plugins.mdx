title: Plugins
---

`auto` uses the package [tapable](https://github.com/webpack/tapable) to expose a plugin system. Go [here](../plugins/writing-plugins) to learn how to write one!

## Using Plugins

To use a plugin you can either supply the plugin via a CLI arg or in your [.autorc](./autorc#plugins).

> :warning: Specifying a plugin overrides the defaults.

### Defaults

If you don't configure plugins in your `.autorc` configuration file `auto` will use a default package manager plugin.

- Installed through `npm` => uses [`npm`](../generated/npm)
- Installed through executable => uses [`git-tag`](../generated/git-tag)

> :warning: For the majority of "package manager" plugins you should only use one at a time.
> Using multiple _will_ lead to undesired results.

### No Plugins

If you don't want to include the default plugins, you can supply an empty array in the `.autorc` configuration file like the following:

```json
{
  "plugins": []
}
```

## Plugin Declaration

There are three ways to name and use a plugin.

### Official Plugins

To use an official plugin all you have to do is supply the name.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "npm",
    // or the full name
    "@auto-it/npm"
  ]
}
```

### `npm` package

Unofficial plugins pulled from NPM should be named in one of the following formats:

- `auto-plugin-PLUGIN_NAME`
- `@my-scope/auto-plugin-PLUGIN_NAME`

You use them in your `.autorc` by:

- provide the full package name
- when named like `auto-plugin-PLUGIN_NAME` just the `PLUGIN_NAME`.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "my-cool-plugin",
    // or
    "auto-plugin-my-cool-plugin",
    // on a scope
    "@my-scope/auto-plugin-my-cool-plugin"
  ]
}
```

### Local Plugin

Or if you have a plugin locally supply the path.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["../path/to/plugin.js"]
}
```

## Plugin Configuration

To provide plugin specific config change the following:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["chrome"]
}
```

To this:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["chrome", { "extensionId": "1234", "build": "my-compiled-extension.zip" }]
  ]
}
```
