title: Travis CI
---

The following config declares the `deploy` job that run on all branches. The job will either release:

- a new `latest` version from `baseBranch`
- a `canary` build from a pull request (if your package manager plugin implements them)

**`.travis.yml`**

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js: "10"

git:
  depth: false

script:
  - yarn lint
  - yarn test
  - yarn build

deploy:
  - provider: script
    script: if [ "$GH_TOKEN" != "false" ];then npx auto shipit; fi;
    skip-cleanup: true
    on:
      all_branches: true
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems make sure you have done the following:

- `GH_TOKEN` is set
- Any other secrets for plugins are set (Ex; `NPM_TOKEN` with the NPM plugin)

### Detached Head (Monorepo)

Some plugins might use tools that require you to be on a branch.
The default setup for travis leaves you in a "Detached Head" state, meaning the git HEAD pointer is not on a branch.
To fix this add the following lines to your `.travis.yml`

```yaml
before_deploy:
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" == "main" ];then
    git checkout main;
    fi;
```

This code will ensure that your git HEAD is on `baseBranch` when creating a new release.

### Canary Deploy Failing on Forks

By default Travis will not pass secrets to forks.
Because of this canaries releases will fail.
You can either:

- Pass secrets to forks (insecure)
- Only run shipit if secrets are available (recommended, in above config)
